    "body": " You always have an option of hiring a consultant or coming up with\n              the name\n              yourself.\n              However, Squadhelp builds great brands that succeed faster by\n              connecting you with\n              the\n              most creative people across the globe. Most importantly, Squadhelp\n              provides you with\n              choice: you get to see ideas from dozens (in some cases, hundreds)\n              of contestants\n              before\n              you select a winner. Typically, you would spend far less money\n              with Squadhelp\n              (our contests start at $199) than hiring an agency. Also, you will\n              receive immediate\n              results - most contests begin receiving submissions within minutes\n              of starting."
